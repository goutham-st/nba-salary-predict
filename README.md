# nba-salary-predict
My final project for the Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science from Dartmouth College

This project synthesizes all of the concepts, skills, and applications I learned during the Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science from Dartmouth College. In this project, I sought to determine whether NBA players' salaries can be predicted using their regular season statistics as well as to determine which model is the best predictor.
