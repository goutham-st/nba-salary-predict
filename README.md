My final project for the Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science from Dartmouth College

This project synthesizes all of the concepts, skills, and applications I learned during the Professional Certificate in Applied Data Science from Dartmouth College. In this project, I sought to determine how well different machine learning models can predict NBA players' salaries using their regular season statistics. Afterwards, I compared model performance to determine which model was the best predictor.
